    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2 class="color-accent-1">General</h2>
    {{ $aboutData := .Site.Data.about }}

    <p>I'm a software engineer that loves to tinker and teach myself new things.</p>
    <p>
      I have deep knowledge of a few subjects, but I'm more of a generalist than a specialist.
      I feel like knowing a lot of different subjects has greatly improved my problem solving and learning abilities.
    </p>
    <p>Life is too short and there are tons of interesting things, so why limit youself to one subject?</p>

    {{ $languages := $aboutData.favoriteLanguages }}
    {{ $languageCount := sub (len $languages) 1 }}
    <p>
      My favorite programming languages are
      {{ range $i, $lang := $languages }}
        {{ if eq $i $languageCount }}
          and {{ $lang }}.
        {{ else if lt $i $languageCount }}
          {{ $lang }}, 
        {{ end }}
      {{ end }}
    </p>

    <h2 class="color-accent-1">Career</h2>

    {{ $start := time ($aboutData.careerStart) }}
    {{ $yearsElapsed := $start.Year | sub now.Year }}
    <p>
      In summary, I'm a software engineer with {{ $yearsElapsed }} years of professional experience.
      The majority of my experience is backend development with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Postgres</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>My resume with more detail is available at <a href="{{ .Site.Params.links.resume }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/resume</a>.</p>
    <p>Based on my interests, I hope to eventually find myself in some kind of role that intersects cybersecurity and computer engineering, but we'll see.</p>
