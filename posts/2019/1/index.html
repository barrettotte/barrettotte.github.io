<p><em>Migrated post from <a href=https://dev.to/barrettotte/rpg-and-the-ibmi-563>DEV.to</a></em></p>
<p>This is my first post to DEV to see if there are any developers on here who have messed around with IBM i before or are interested in learning what it is. Primarily, I will be focusing on the history of IBM i and the RPG programming language that has evolved with it.</p>
<p>At my current workplace, I noticed this ominous green and black screen on numerous older developers' monitors. Shortly after, I found out that my company develops and maintains an IBM i system with an RPG(LE) codebase. I was immediately intrigued and set out to learn what was happening. The problem is that learning a new paradigm of thinking is difficult.</p>
<p>Since I was a web developer and expressed a bit of interest in learning IBM i, I was given a user account and library that I could mess around with. I searched around various sites and some IBM documentation for a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo;. But, I quickly learned that there really isn&rsquo;t too great of a starting point compared to learning every other programming language and/or OS.</p>
<h2 id=an-important-lesson>An Important Lesson</h2>

<p>If you ever find yourself wanting to learn RPG by purchasing a used AS/400 on eBay, don&rsquo;t do it (unless you have an additional $20K). IBM is cool, but their software is expensive and closed source. So, I have a pretty sweet 500lb bar table in my basement now.</p>
<h2 id=brief-introduction>Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>IBM i is an OS that works very well with business applications, reporting, data warehousing, and more. It also comes with a built in database called DB2 which uses its own little flavor of SQL.</p>
<p>IBM i also has the ability to use many languages such as RPG, CL, DDS, COBOL, BASIC, C/C++, Java, Python, DB2 SQL, and REXX. There is a lot to this machine, but at a high level this amount of information should be sufficient.</p>
<p>A big selling point of IBM i is its stability. According to developers at my workplace, our IBM i system has only needed to be rebooted once in its 30+ years of operation.</p>
<h2 id=brief-history>Brief History</h2>
<p>IBM i evolved a lot over time and often gets confusing trying to google things. The easiest way to trace its evolution is to follow the RPG programming language.</p>
<ul>
<li>1959ish <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1400_series>IBM 1400 series</a> - <strong>RPG I</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Punch cards and magnetic tape</strong></li>
<li>Also supported COBOL, FORTRAN, and some ancient ASM languages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1969-1977 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/3>IBM System/3</a> - <strong>RPG II</strong>
<ul>
<li>Also supported COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1978 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/38>IBM System/38</a> - <strong>RPG III</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disk storage, diskette drive, etc.</li>
<li>Also supported COBOL, BASIC, PL/I</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1988 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_i><strong>Application System/400 - AS/400</strong></a> - <strong>RPG 400/IV</strong>
<ul>
<li>Also supported ASM, C/C++, COBOL, Python, REXX, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2000 - renamed to iSeries</li>
<li>2006 - renamed to System i</li>
</ul>
<p>I glossed over a lot of information, but feel free to read more.</p>
<h2 id=rpg>RPG</h2>
<p><img src=seu.PNG alt=seu.PNG></p>
<p>So, wait&mldr;RPG has been around since around <strong>1960</strong>?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>RPG (Report Program Generator)</strong> started out on punch cards as a programming language that was used for generating reports. Over its life span, RPG received new features/changes and can currently be used like a general purpose programming language.</p>
<p>RPG fixed-format looks so ugly because of its origin. Therefore, RPG&rsquo;s grammar is dependent on certain columns needing specific data.</p>
<p>Gradually, RPG evolved out of its fixed-format ancestry and took a free-format appearance. IBM made sure that there was a decent amount of backwards compatibility between version of RPG. For example, on the AS/400 you could have a mix of RPG III and RPG IV programs. With RPG&rsquo;s evolution into free-format</p>
<p>RPG is sometimes referred to as RPGLE. Without getting into too much detail: On IBM i, there is the concept of <strong>Integrated Language Environment (ILE)</strong> languages. ILE languages can talk to other ILE languages. This includes CL, COBOL, C/C++, RPG, and more. Modern RPG development is typically using RPGLE.</p>
<h3 id=hello-world-in-fixed-format-rpg-rpg-iii>Hello World in fixed-format RPG (RPG III)</h3>
<pre tabindex=0><code>      C                     MOVEL'HELLO'   HELLO  11

      C           HELLO     DSPLY          WAIT    1
      C                     SETON                     LR

<pre tabindex=0><code>      C     'Hello World' DSPLY
      C                   SETON                                        LR
</code></pre><h3 id=hello-world-in-free-format-rpgle-rpg-iv>Hello World in free-format RPGLE (RPG IV)</h3>
<pre tabindex=0><code>       /free
       dsply ('Hello World');
       *inlr = *on
</code></pre><p>With the use of the <strong>/free</strong> and <strong>/end-free</strong> you can mix and match fixed and free RPGLE.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is just a small glimpse at IBM i. There is a mountain of information to learn about the machine, most of which I haven&rsquo;t learned yet. I know this was probably confusing, but I hope my writing was coherent enough to enjoy reading. If anyone would like to read and learn more about IBM i let me know in the comments. I&rsquo;d love to keep making posts like this.</p>
<p>Possible future posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Control Language (CL) ?</li>
<li>What is Data Description Specification (DDS) ?</li>
<li>IBM i file structure, Physical Files, and Logical Files</li>
<li>Calling IBM i from Java, Python, and more</li>
<li>Writing a basic RPGLE program</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=my-ibm-i-projects>My IBM i &ldquo;Projects&rdquo;</h2>
<p>To start learning I made a small repository to dump random files and notes into; Located at <a href=https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG>https://github.com/barrettotte/IBM-RPG</a></p>
<p>I am writing a small &ldquo;book&rdquo; called &ldquo;Learning IBM i as a Lowly Web Developer&rdquo; (obviously the title is poking fun). This book will be a casual guide to IBM i , introductions to various obscure languages (RPGLE, CL, DDS, REXX, COBOL, etc), and a short course to wrap-up concepts.</p>
<p>To go along with my book, I am casually developing an IBM i VS Code extension and editor API to enable viewing, editing, and compiling IBM i code from the comfort of VS Code.</p>
