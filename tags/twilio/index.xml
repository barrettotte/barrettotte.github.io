(This was a submission to a Twilio hackathon)
What I built Category Submission: Exciting X-Factors Send a text message from a TRS-80 Model 100 using the Twilio SMS API and an ESP8266.
The basic goal was to use a vintage computer as a frontend and an ESP8266 as a backend to send a text message.
As I state in my repository, In no way is this practical or should be recreated.</description></item><item><title>Sending a Text Message with Twilio and DB2 SQL</title><link>https://barrettotte.github.com/posts/11/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://barrettotte.github.com/posts/11/</guid><description>Migrated post from DEV.to
This is going to be a pretty short post, but I thought it would be fun to share this in light of the Twilio + DEV hackathon this month. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if either project I planned out will be finished in time. This month went by way too fast, so the outlook is not good.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m still a pretty new IBMi developer, I found that the best way to learn this new world was to take a fun idea and see if it was possible to do with RPG and/or DB2 SQL.</description></item></channel></rss>
