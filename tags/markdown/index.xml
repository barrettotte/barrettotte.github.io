The history of computing is tangled up with mathematics, physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and more. So, this book will be multidisciplinary, but hopefully only cover the important pieces needed for computing. However, I already know there will be short optional detours into other topics that make sense to mention.</description></item><item><title>Writing a Book with Docsify</title><link>https://barrettotte.github.io/posts/2019/3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://barrettotte.github.io/posts/2019/3/</guid><description>Migrated post from DEV.to
If you ever thought about writing a small book in the comfort of markdown/html then I would suggest using Docsify; https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify
Docsify is pretty intuitive and has sufficient documentation to get you through the basics of putting together a book. Each directory is a section and each markdown file is a page in the book. It also has other features such as navigation, cover pages, and sidebars that I haven&amp;rsquo;t dove too deep into.</description></item></channel></rss>
