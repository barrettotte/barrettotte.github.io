What I built Category Submission: Exciting X-Factors Send a text message from a TRS-80 Model 100 using the Twilio SMS API and an ESP8266.
The basic goal was to use a vintage computer as a frontend and an ESP8266 as a backend to send a text message.
As I state in my repository, In no way is this practical or should be recreated.</description></item></channel></rss>
