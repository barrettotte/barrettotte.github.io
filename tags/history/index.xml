The history of computing is tangled up with mathematics, physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and more. So, this book will be multidisciplinary, but hopefully only cover the important pieces needed for computing. However, I already know there will be short optional detours into other topics that make sense to mention.</description></item></channel></rss>
