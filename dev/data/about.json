  "summary": [
    "I am a software developer and lifelong student aspiring to learn a little bit of everything.",
    "Against my better judgement, coding became my main hobby and I am always working on some kind of side project. I have a long list of project ideas and things I want to learn. This list grows faster than it shrinks; I hope to never see the end of the list.",
    "Besides learning new topics in computer science and software development, I hope to eventually branch out into physics, mathematics, and history.",
    "I've jumped around between a pretty good deal of programming languages so far. My favorite languages include: Python, C#, C, Groovy, Assembly, and TypeScript.",
    "In my opinion, one of the most important things a developer can do is solve problems outside of their comfort zone. To encourage constant growth as a developer, I often times purposefully learn something difficult that I have no understanding of.",
    "Even though I am currently a software developer, I hope to go back to college for my M.S. in either Programming Language Theory or Embedded Systems. Unfortunately, topics such as programming languages, low-level programming, and theoretical computer science fascinate me a lot more than writing software does.",
    "Besides coding, I like to tinker with electronics, exercise, and watch anime."
