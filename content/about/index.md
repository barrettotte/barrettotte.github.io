## Career

I'm a software engineer with the bulk of my official experience in **Java**, **Angular**, and **Postgres**. 
But, I pride myself in being able to learn any language or technology necessary to complete a goal.
My full work history is listed on my [resume]({{< param links.resume >}}), so you have the option to skip the rest of this page.

A week after I graduated, I started at a small insurance company as a fullstack developer with Java, 
ColdFusion, JavaScript, Angular, XSLT, DB2 SQL, and MSSQL. After 1.5 years, at the same company I 
transitioned to the hardest thing I've learned and worked with so far, [IBM i (AS/400)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i) 
and [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG). 
For about a year I was a half web developer and half mainframe developer. During this time I was able to apply 
modern software practices/tools to a very old and growing codebase. 

I eventually developed a VS Code extension, [vscode-ibmi-languages](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=barrettotte.ibmi-languages), 
which provided syntax highlighting for 10+ unsupported file types so that I (and others) could reason about old IBM i code much easier. 
Around the same time I wrote a small eBook, [Learning IBM i as a Web Developer](https://barrettotte.github.io/IBMi-Book/#/), 
which provided a simplified path for web developers to learn IBM i and some of its mysteries.
I was also able to contribute to GitHub's [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) 
to provide [syntax highlighting for RPGLE](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/5240).

Working with both legacy mainframe and web development allowed me to contribute new features from "bedrock to browser". 
I think this part of my career was crucial in cultivating my problem solving skills and resourcefulness.
