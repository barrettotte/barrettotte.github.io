## Long Term Goals

Some large projects/efforts that I will train myself to complete one day via self-study and smaller side projects.

- Build a mechanical clock
- Build a mechanical calculator
- Make a transistor from scratch
- Make a vacuum tube from scratch
- Build a homebrew CPU with an OS and more
- Build a radio astronomy station
- Build a basic scanning electron microscope
- Build a fusor
- Create and publish a small game to Steam
- Complete *From Stones to Qubits* project

I have a lot more goals, but it would be excessive to list all of them here.

## Self-Study

Besides computer related topics, I plan to chip away at the following topics over the years:

- General Physics and various subtopics
- General Chemistry and various subtopics
- General Biology and Microbiology
- Entomology
- Mineralogy
- Semiconductor Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Automotive Engineering
- Watchmaking
- Linguistics and Languages
- Ancient History and World History
- Various Religions
- Astronomy

There's probably more and I hope I have enough time and energy to keep learning everything.
