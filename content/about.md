## Career

In summary, I'm a software engineer with the bulk of my official experience in **Java**, **Angular**, and **Postgres**.
My resume with more detail is available at 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barrettotte/Resume/master/barrettotte-resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">/resume</a>.

## Self-Study

I plan to eventually release my yearly lists that detail what 
I've been learning and working on from 2010-present, called **yygdrasil**. 
It won't be all that useful, but may give some people the idea to start 
tracking things like this and be self-reflective.
