I've been digging around my old archived code and found a gem I have to record for myself.

```c++
// HelloWorld.cpp

// Barrett Otte
// 9-06-11
// Purpose: Demonstrate Dev Compiler

# include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
          cout << "Hello World\n" ;
          system ("PAUSE") ;
          return 0;
}

```

Man, just look at the formatting...

Its hard to believe its been ~10 years since that first program in my first high school programming class.
During my 4 high school programming classes, I definitely learned a lot that prepared me plenty for college.
I only took this first programming class on a whim because I thought it would be more useful than taking a
"home ec" elective; I'm beyond grateful I made this choice. Call me sentimental, I'm so glad I kept this.

That's it, I just wanted to record this so I can look back on it in another 10 years.
