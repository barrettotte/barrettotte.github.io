## Summary/Purpose

This book, *From Stones to Qubits*, will be my attempt to study, document, and teach 
how humanity developed computing from the Stone Age to modern day.

The history of computing is tangled up with mathematics, physics, materials science, electrical engineering, and more.
So, this book will be multidisciplinary, but hopefully only cover the important pieces needed for computing.
However, I already know there will be short optional detours into other topics that make sense to mention.

For example, to get to the concept of ARPANET at a high level I'm guessing I would at some point have to cover 
electromagnetism, circuits, telegraphs, telephones, telecommunication networks, teletypes, IMP, TCP/IP, and more.
But, the more you think about each of these items, the more innovations they unravel and relate to.
So, it will be interesting to see how I manage to power through this.

In general, I want to provide a smooth learning path for other people that like to tinker and learn how/why things work the way they do.
I also hope that this book will educate people on how intelligent people in the past were and how
important their contributions were to arriving at modern day computing.

*From Stones to Qubits* will be my "magnum opus" project for years to come and I really hope I complete it one day.
I'm a big supporter of open source education and this will never be monetized; Making money isn't the point of this project.

## Initial Plan

This is my initial plan for the book, but it will most definitely change as I learn more.
Each of these sections will take years to complete.

- Part I: History of Computing
  - Prehistory and Ancient History (3400 BCE - 500 CE)
  - Middle Ages (500 - 1500)
  - Modern History I (1500 - 1799)
  - Modern History II (1800 - 1949)
  - Modern History III (1950 - 1999)
  - Modern History IV (2000 - present)
- Part II: Transistor to Web Browser
  - Atoms, Electromagnetism, and Circuits
  - Semiconductors, Transistors, and ICs
  - Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates
  - CPU Architecture
  - Hardware Description Languages and FPGAs

  - Future

### Part I: History of Computing

Part I will detail the history of computing and related disciplines from the Stone Age to modern day. 
This will include related disciplines like mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, 
materials science, and more.

When progressing through history I'll include optional projects that can be 3D printed (if possible).
This includes projects like an abacus, clock, mechanical calculator, Leyden jar, electroscope, 
telegraph, electromechanical ALU, and more.

This section is entirely optional and if people don't care, no worries.

### Part II: Transistor to Web Browser

Part II will be focused on how to get from transistors to a basic text-based web browser.
Projects include a small CPU core, assembler, compiler, operating system, TCP/IP stack, and a basic text-based web browser.

The CPU core will be built using Verilog and an FPGA for ease of development.

These projects won't be perfect. But, they should be more than enough to demonstrate
the goal/spirit of this book. Obviously, 

### Part III: Quantum Computing

Part III will be covering quantum computing and algorithms with no prior knowledge needed.
I'm assuming I'll provide a crash course in the mathematics needed and then dive straight into
quantum logic gates. I'll probably end up using a mix of Q#, Qiskit, and IBM Quantum Experience.

To be honest, I haven't dove into quantum computing enough myself to be able to come up
with some sort of end goal or project idea. But, I'll probably find something eventually.
