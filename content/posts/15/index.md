## Introduction to Octo

[Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) is a high level assembler for an old virtual machine, 
[CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8),
which was developed in the mid-1970s. Its a VM with some basic audio, graphics, and input.
Game jams with constraints like this are the most fun.

I used the following resources to learn from:

- [Octo IDE](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/)
- [Octo Assembly Language Manual](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/blob/gh-pages/docs/Manual.md)
- [A Beginner's Guide to Programming with Chip8](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/blob/gh-pages/docs/BeginnersGuide.md)
- [An Intermediate Guide to Game Development with Chip8](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/blob/gh-pages/docs/IntermediateGuide.md)
- [Chip8 Programming Techniques](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo/blob/gh-pages/docs/Chip8%20Programming.md)

## Octojam 7

I intended on attending a game jam called [Octojam 7](https://itch.io/jam/octojam-7) 
running from 10-01-2020 to 11-01-2020. This was a jam meant to be completed with only Octo.

My idea was a simple two player artillery game. Each player would change the angle and power of a projectile
to try to eliminate the other player. This would require inputs, audio, projectile motion calculation, and collisions.

While it was fun to learn Octo, I ended up not being able to complete anything to submit.
I had too many other projects going on that month and this one got taken off the list.
Hopefully in the future I can attend another one.

## Projectile Motion Prototype

The only formulas needed are:

$x(t) = x_0 + v_{x0}t\cos(\theta)$

$y(t) = y_0 + v_{y0}t\sin(\theta)$

Before starting in assembly, I put together a simple projectile motion prototype using pygame.

![projectile-motion.png](projectile-motion.png)

`game.py`

```py
import pygame, math, time

pygame.init()
(width, height) = (1200, 800)
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
screen.fill((64, 64, 64))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

pos_scale = 0.1      # scale position down so it fits on small screen
height_error = 0.01  # tolerable error for max height of projectile
g = 9.8              # gravity
theta = 45           # projectile angle

# initial values
v_0 = 250                                  # initial velocity (magnitude)
vx_0 = v_0 * math.cos(theta)               # initial velocity x component
vy_0 = v_0 * math.sin(theta)               # initial velocity y component
(x_0, y_0) = (width * 0.25, height * 0.5)  # initial positions

# estimations
flight_time = (2*vy_0) / g
max_height = ((vy_0**2) / (2*g)) * pos_scale

(x_pos, y_pos, t) = (0,0,0)

while True:
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      pygame.quit()
      exit()

  if y_pos <= y_0:
    color = (255,0,0) if y_pos < (max_height * (1 + height_error)) else (0,255,0)
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, color, (int(x_pos), int(y_pos)), 2)

    x_pos = x_0 + ((vx_0 * t * math.cos(theta)) * pos_scale)
    y_pos = y_0 - ((vy_0 * t * math.sin(theta) - (0.5 * g * (t**2))) * pos_scale)
    print('t = {}, pos = ({:2f}, {:2f})'.format(t, x_pos, y_pos))

    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(60)
    time.sleep(0.1)
    t += 0.50
```

## My "Entry"

This is the only thing I managed to code up. A BCD scoreboard controlled with the arrow keys.
