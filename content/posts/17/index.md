I randomly decided to learn about how QR codes work.
It turns out there's some pretty cool things to learn such as 
[Reed-Solomon Error Correction]()
and [Galois Fields]().

At my job I decided to give a "Lunch and Learn" about the basics of
generating a QR code in Python. The QR code generated below is a link 
to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/barrettotte/).

This presentation was done in a Jupyter notebook interactively and has not been converted to markdown at this time.
See the Jupyter Notebook [on my GitHub](https://github.com/barrettotte/qr-asm/blob/master/docs/jupyter/lunch-and-learn.ipynb).
